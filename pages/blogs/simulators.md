## Multicore Architectures

### McPAT

McPAT enables architects to consistently quantify the cost of new ideas and
assess tradeoffs of different architectures using new metrics like energy-delay-area<sup>2</sup> product (EDA<sup>2</sup>P) and energy-delayarea product (EDAP).
It can model the area and power of the register files and the SRAM buffers.

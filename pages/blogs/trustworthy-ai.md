### Trustworthy AI Description

- [x] [arXiv 2025] **AI Safety vs. AI Security: Demystifying the Distinction and Boundaries.** [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/paper-7EA6E0)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18932) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/slides-E29135)](https://zhiqlin.github.io/file/talks/AI_Safety_Security_July_17_2025.pdf)


Building trustworthy AI requires addressing both AI safety and AI security concerns. AI safety focuses on preventing unintended failures, including system malfunctions, design limitations, and unexpected behaviors that can arise during normal operation. In contrast, AI security addresses malicious exploitation threats, such as deliberate system manipulation, data poisoning attacks, and adversarial perturbations designed to compromise AI systems.
